Before you run the code, you must download the yolov8 keypoint detection weight in this link :
https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/#models 
You can choose whatever you want, but i recommend the YOLOv8n-pose because it's have a lower computation then the others.

If you just want to run the model, you can download my DNN/CNN/Xgboost weight via this link :

for CNN and DNN, you must download the JSON file too because the JSON file save my CNN/DNN architecture.
