Use YoloV8 pose detection to get a human keypoint and save it for training a Machine learning and Neural Network for detecting human pose, In this section I will detect if the human do a cutting pose or no.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you run the code, you must download the yolov8 keypoint detection weight in this link :
https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/#models 
You can choose whatever you want, but I recommend the YOLOv8n-pose because it has a lower computation than the others.

If you just want to run the model, you can download my DNN/CNN/Xgboost weight via this link :

for CNN and DNN, you must download the JSON file too because the JSON file saves my CNN/DNN architecture.
